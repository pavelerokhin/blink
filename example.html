          Aesthetics, or esthetics (/ɛsˈθɛtɪks, iːs-, æs-/), is a branch of
          philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty and taste, as well as
          the philosophy of art (its own area of philosophy that comes out of
          aesthetics). It examines aesthetic values, often expressed through
          judgments of taste. Scholars in the field have defined aesthetics as
          "critical reflection on art, culture and nature". In modern English,
          the term "aesthetic" can also refer to a set of principles underlying
          the works of a particular art movement or theory (one speaks, for
          example, of a Renaissance aesthetic).

          Aesthetics covers both natural and artificial sources of aesthetic
          experience and judgment. It considers what happens in our minds when
          we engage with aesthetic objects or environments such as viewing
          visual art, listening to music, reading poetry, experiencing a play,
          or exploring nature. The philosophy of art specifically studies how
          artists imagine, create, and perform works of art, as well as how
          people use, enjoy, and criticize art. Aesthetics considers why people
          like some works of art and not others, as well as how art can affect
          moods or even our beliefs. Both aesthetics and the philosophy of art
          ask questions like "What is art?," "What is a work of art?," and "What
          makes good art?"
